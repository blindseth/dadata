Workspace for various data projects. Most of what you'll find here is in the exploratory slash work in progress stage, with a few separate notebooks exploring stuff like seaborn and scikit-learn. As for the projects / directories, a healthy chunkslice of this hovers, drone buzzing and looking down at the movement of people in time and space and particularly via bicycles and public transportation. I also have some preliminary Code for SF SBA work in here for now. And the kaggle Titanic stuff too, because why not. Likely to be split apart once more is up here.
