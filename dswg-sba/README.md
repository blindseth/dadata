Placeholder for exploratory data analysis on SBA loan data available here: https://www.sba.gov/about-sba/sba-performance/open-government/foia/frequently-requested-records/sba-7a-504-loan-data-reports
 

Here's some background info on the SBA loans covered in the data:


### 7(a) Loan Program
The 7(a) Loan program is the SBA’s primary business loan program. It is the agency’s most frequently used non-disaster financial assistance program because of its flexibility in loan structure, variety of uses for the loan proceeds and availability. The program has broad eligibility requirements and credit criteria to accommodate a wide 
range of financing needs.

...In the Federal Government’s 2013 Fiscal Year ... about 80 percent of the dollars and 38 percent of the number of all 7(a) loans were Basic 7(a) Loans.

...Since 1996, all 7(a) loans have only been provided on a guaranteed basis, meaning from a lender participating in the 7(a) Loan Guaranty Program

...The lender will generally review the credit merits of the request before deciding if they will make the loan themselves or if they will need an SBA guaranty. If a guaranty is needed, the lender will also review the application for SBA eligibility. The applicant should be prepared to complete some additional documents if the lender says they need an SBA guaranty for approval. Applicants who feel they need more help with the process should contact their local SBA district office or one of the SBA’s resource partners for assistance.


### 504 Loan Program (through Certified Development Companies)
~ The SBA 504 loan (vs the 7(a) loan) is 'packaged' by CDC, (is similarly for ~$5m) for businesses that create jobs, meet a public policy goal (rural development, expansion of small businesses run by veterans, women, & minorities ..or manufacturer & energy related policy goal)

...the 504 loan program provides long-term, fixed-rate, subordinate mortgage financing for acquisition and/or renovation of capital assets including land, buildings  and equipment. Some refinancing is also permitted. Most for-profit small businesses are eligible for this program. 

CDCs work with banks and other lenders to make loans in first position on reasonable terms, helping lenders retain growing customers and provide Community Reinvestment Act credit.

~ Businesses that receive 504 loans are: small (net worth under $15 million, net profit after taxes under $5 million, or meet other SBA size standards) & organized for-profit.
